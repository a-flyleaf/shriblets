- title: heighthell
  date: "2018-08"
  desc: |-
    Interactive character height chart, heavily inspired by <a href="http://mxedk.com/pokechamp/">a version with Pokémon player characters</a>, and one of my first experiments with Javascript. (Could not figure out how to make the characters stand separately on pageload without altering the draggable area, and the toggles are buggy.)

- title: headshots
  date: "2018-12-14"
  desc: |-
    Assorted characters and an overview of the stories they’re from. (There are names and one-sentence descriptions in the code, but I never figured out how to make the varying line lengths not break the layout.)

    A page of <a href="http://feltron.com/FAR07.html">Nicholas Feltron’s 2007 Annual Report</a>, but as a HTML page. Experimenting with CSS grid.

- title: art
  date: "2020-06-07"

    Something of a portfolio page. Unfinished-ish; layout looks best single-column but widescreen doesn’t break.

    An <a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io/blog/addition-update">exploration</a> of parallel dysfunction, in the format of divided HTML frames; based on <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/my-boyfriend-came-back-from-the-war"><i>My Boyfriend Came Back from the War</i></a>

    A recode of this page, since I thought it deserved its own layout; implemented same day. Images via <a href="https://placeholder.com">placeholder.com</a>.

- title: tracklist
  date: "2021-10-03+04"

    Character song page; doubles as an attempt to use dynamic/responsive text over an image. Probably looks weird on old browsers.

    Revisiting the 2018 height chart (see above), now with lots more people and entirely different base code. (Functionally much simpler, but characters don’t overlap on pageload.) Image rescaling might be weird on some browsers.

    Plain-’n-simple attempt to use page-specific data to generate talksprites. The meat is in the backend; didn’t bother prettying up the results.
